# New movement binds after the nerf update.
Create a folder on game\csgo\cfg\ and name it movement, then download the configs on this github page and put them all there.
Second part, you create a autoexec.cfg then put these following commands in it:
(PLEASE EXEC MOVEMENT/SETUP TOO)

//
bind alt +jb
bind mouse4 +lj
bind c +lj
bind mwheeldown j
bind mwheelup j
bind ctrl +d
bind mouse5 +d
bind mouse3 +d

exec movement/setup
//
