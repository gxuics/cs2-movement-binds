# New movement binds after the nerf update.
Create a folder on game\csgo\cfg\movement then download the configs on this github page and put them all there (create a movement folder if you don't have it).
Second part, download the autoexec and put it on game\csgo\cfg

Note that you have to exec it everytime u open the game, also change the binds to your own on autoexec if you don't like what i have.
